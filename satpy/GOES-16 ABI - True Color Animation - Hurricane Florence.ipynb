    "This example shows how to take multiple time steps of ABI data and combine them in to a single mp4 movie file as an animation. The example uses 100 frames of mesoscale images from the GOES-16 ABI instrument on September 11th, 2018 from 1300Z to 1440Z with one image every minute. The \"%%time\" magic command is used in jupyter notebook to time the entire cell's execution. This example took about 8 minutes and 30 seconds on a 2015 macbook using 8 dask threaded workers.\n",

    "The frames in the movie are 500m resolution true color images with solar zenith and rayleigh scattering corrections applied. A ratio sharpening technique was also used to bring out more detail from the lower resolution input bands. All of this is pre-configured for the ABI 'true_color' composite in satpy and is done from python."

    "# Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to use dask in a multiprocess environment to compute multiple animation frames at once. We do this by first creating a dask `Client` object which will create external dask workers for us. We then pass this client object to `save_animation` along with a `batch_size`. This tells Satpy to compute `16` frames at a time by using the parallel multiprocess workers created by dask. Without this, Satpy will default to computing one frame at a time. Depending on your system, this can cut off minutes of processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The creation of the `Client` below includes making a dashboard available for viewing tasks as they are worked on by dask."
