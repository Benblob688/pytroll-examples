    "1. You should have X2Go already installed on your laptop, so go ahead and start it up using your TCE credentials\n",

    "You should have an indication in your terminal prompt that the conda environment is active, e.g.:\n",
    "`(troll) joro@x2g13:~ $`. When the `conda` environment is active, all the installations after this point will go only to this specific environment. The environment can be deactivated with `source deactivate`-command.\n",

    "\n",
    "Though `conda` installations are not necessary for this training, any missing modules and packages can be installed to your environment. Usually it's best to google the module, e.g., \"conda install pycoast\" and follow the instructions. In case of `pycoast`, the installation would be\n",
